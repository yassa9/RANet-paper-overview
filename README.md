# RANet-paper-overview
TensorFlow-based prototype of RANet, a Ranking Attention Network designed for fast and accurate video object segmentation, suitable for real-time applications. 

## Overview
This repository contains a TensorFlow prototype implementation of the Ranking Attention Network (RANet), originally designed for fast and accurate video object segmentation (VOS). 
RANet integrates advanced deep learning techniques to enhance segmentation speed without sacrificing precision, making it ideal for real-time applications.

## Project Context
This project was developed as part of the CSE477s: Fundamentals of Deep Learning course at Ain Shams University. 
It is inspired by the challenges of traditional VOS methods, which while accurate, are computationally intensive and slow, making them unsuitable for real-time processing.

## Model Details
### `Siamese Encoder`: Extracts detailed features from each video frame, ensuring the network recognizes important aspects of each frame, particularly relating to the object that needs to be segmented.
### `Correlation Layer`: Processes features from consecutive frames to maintain temporal consistency and capture object motion and transformation across frames.
### `Decoder`: Reconstructs the segmentation mask from the correlated features, outputting a high-resolution segmentation that accurately tracks the object across the video sequence.

For educational purposes, this implementation focuses on the core architecture of RANet, including simplified versions of the ranking attention mechanisms described in the original paper.

## Goals
To understand and prototyply implement the underlying architecture and operations of RANet.
To explore the impact of the ranking attention mechanism on the performance of video object segmentation tasks.
To provide a basis for further experimentation and improvement on real-time video object segmentation methods.

## Datasets
This implementation is tested on the DAVIS 2016 and 2017 datasets.
